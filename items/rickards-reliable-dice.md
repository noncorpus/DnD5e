# Rickard's Reliable Dice

You have one Reliable Die of each type (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). After a roll of any kind, you may roll a Reliable Die of the same kind and add to, subtract from, or replace the roll. After being used, the pips on the used die fade and it cannot be used again until they reappear at sunrise. A Reliable Die cannot be applied to someone else's roll, such as a monster's attack roll against you.

You may give a Reliable Die to a party member outside of combat, or in combat as a bonus action if you are within reach.
