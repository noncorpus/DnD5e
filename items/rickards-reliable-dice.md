# Rickard's Reliable Dice

You have one Reliable Die. After any roll is made by or against the holder, you may roll it to select the second die you will roll (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). You may roll this die after the result of the roll. Add the die roll, or subtract it from, the triggering roll.

After being used, the pips on the used die fade and it cannot be used again until they reappear at sunrise. A Reliable Die cannot be applied to someone else's roll, such as a monster's attack roll against you.

You may give a Reliable Die to a party member outside of combat, or in combat as a bonus action if you are within reach.
