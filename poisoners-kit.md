__Poisoner’s Kit__
* INT-based Tool (can gain proficiency)
* Cost: 50 GP
    * Must be "restocked" for 10 GP every 10 uses.
* Allows creation of poisons using the following base:
    * __Create DC:__ 10
    * __Damage Type:__ Poison
    * __Damage (Immediate):__ 0
    * __Damage (Per Round):__ 0
    * __Condition:__ Poisoned
    * __Effect Duration:__ 1 minute
    * __On-Weapon Duration:__ 3 attacks
    * __Application:__ Contact
    * __Save DC:__ 8 + Poisoner's Kit Skill CON Save
* To create sophisticated poisons, choose traits you wish for the poison to have on the Poison Traits table. For each trait, increase the Create DC by the listed amount.
* Once all the traits are selected, the poisoner may then reduce the DC with any of the following materials:
    * Money (pays for finer materials, better instruments, etc.): __Create DC -1/5 GP Spent__
    * Ingredients (better ingredients allow poisons to be made more easily)
        * Some ingredients may only reduce DC for certain kinds of poisons (example: Create DC -5 for a Contact Poison that deals d8 damage per round).
        * In some games, some Poison Traits may require certain ingredients (example: your DM explains that a Fire damage poison cannot be made without crushed fire beetle shells, which also give Create DC -10).
    * Additional Circumstances (as ruled by your GM)
        * Poisoner's Laboratory: __Create DC -10__ (Basically a MEGA Poisoner's Kit - Costs 3000 GP to build; 60 GP to restock after 10 uses)
        * Poison Expertise: If your character is able to gain additional proficiency in a certain style of poison, your DM may allow a Create DC reduction to that type.
* When you are ready to create the poison, roll a Poisoner's Kit check. On a success, the poison was completed. On a failure, the DM will roll 1d6 and consult the Poison Failure list to see the result, which may or may not be revealed to you.
    * _Time to Complete_ (8 hr. or under can be done during a Long Rest, 1 hr. or under can be done during a Short Rest)
        * Create DC 0-5: 5 mi.
        * Create DC 6-10: 1 hr.
        * Create DC 11-15: 4 hr.
        * Create DC 15-20: 8 hr.
        * Create DC 20-25: 24 hr.
        * Create DC 25+: DM Discretion
    * _Poison Failure_
        1. Poison is inert, and you are exposed to the ingredients and suffer the effects of the poison yourself.
        2. Poison is inert, and it consumes the remaining uses of your Poisoner’s Kit (so it must be restocked).
        3. Poison is inert
        4. Poison is inert
        5. Poison possesses a combination of traits unknown to you (can learn by passing the Create DC used to make it).
        6. Poison is instead a random Potion (see _DMG_)
