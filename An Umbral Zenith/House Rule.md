# House Rules

## Character Creation

**Attribute Rolls**:  4d6 reroll the lowest, drop the lowest.  Do this eight times and keep the highest 6 scores.

**Hit Points**:  Start at max hit points for available hit dice at 1st level.  Subsequent rolls of hit dice to add hit points require re-rolls of values of 1 or 2.

## Magic

**Divine Magic**:  Casters of divine magic are not required to prepare spells at the beginning of each day. Rather they are only beholden to any restrictions from chosen domains or limitations placed by their belief system. Spells per day are kept as RAW.

**Arcane Magic**:  A spellcaster who has exhausted his allotment of spells of a particular level may choose to overcast.  Overcasting requires that the caster have the spell in question in his/her list of known spells.  When overcasting, the caster take damage equal to the level of the spell squared plus the level of the spell.

| Spell Level | Damage Taken | Notes                |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1           |            2 |                      |
| 2           |            6 |                      |
| 3           |           12 |                      |
| 4           |           20 |                      |
| 5           |           30 |                      |
| 6           |           42 |                      |
| 7\*         |           56 | Massive Damage DC 16 |
| 8\*         |           72 | Massive Damage DC 32 |
| 9\*         |           90 | Massive Damage DC 50 |
\* - triggers a Constitution save vs. Massive Damage

This damage occurs immediately after the duration of the spell cast ends.  Attempting to overcast requires a successful Concentration check at a DC of 20 + level of the spell. Characters who fail the Concentration check take no damage, but neither does the spell work. Characters who fail their Constitution save vs. massive damage are completely destroyed.  Only a Miracle or Wish spell may resurrect them.
