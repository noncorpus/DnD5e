# Vedent Tol

## Geography

The island nation of Vedent Tol is positioned roughly equidistantly from its continental neighbors to the east and west.  As such, it enjoys the privilege of being a convenient waypoint for ships traveling between the two larger land masses.  The island is approximately 20 miles long longitudinally and 30 miles wide latitudinally.  There is only one city on the island, Canné Tol which is located atop the cliffs, high above the port waters.  Numerous smaller fishing and trade villages are scattered along the rest of the coastline, though Canné Tol sees the greatest share of the trade.

South of the capital, lie the Remnant Mountains, so named for the ancient geological cataclysm that created them.  From the middle of the island, high in the mountains, the island’s only major river flows down, passing through Canné Tol and over the cliffs in an impressive waterfall.  On either side of the river, and rising partially up the foothills in terraces, is the island’s only farmland.  The rest of the island is mostly covered in moderate to dense coniferous forest.

## Politics

Vedent Tol is ruled by a matriarchal monarchy whose lines of succession are documented for scores of generations in the Mother Tomes (a collection of books written in great detail for each member of the royal family).  In her mid-40’s, the current ruler, Queen Theres, is a seasoned ruler with several heirs (two girls, three boys), and is widely seen as a fair and just monarch.

## Religion

Vedent Tol is home to several faiths, including the native mainstream Church of the Tides, which reveres a sea god who is said to make his home under the bay beneath Canné Tol.  As such, those on the island following this faith often face to the north when uttering a prayer.

Other non-native faiths have also taken up residence on the island, but are largely located only in the capital.  The presence of these other churches and temples is mostly for the convenience of the numerous traders and seafarers who make the island their waypoint between other destinations.  No real effort is made to conduct missionary work, as the native islanders are mostly content with their own religion.

Finally, the island is home to several secretive cults.  Few people know of their real names, and their membership is equally secretive.  Rumors have circulated concerning their motives and ranks, and it is not an uncommon practice to accuse an enemy of belonging to or consorting with a cult.  While these cults are not outlawed, they are shunned at best and feared at worst.
