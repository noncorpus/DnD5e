# Episode 3
**3/06/2017**
- Korra remembers a dream with Alta
- Korra (human, streaks of grey in her dark brown hair)
- She's an apothecary for the locals
- Korra seems bothered by mention of Sirrus but perks up at Alta's name
- Korra is in shock after hearing of Alta (we fill her into the details)
- What is Sirrus? Apagean - they seem facscinated by our world, like tourists
- Her work was mostly observance
- Korra is terrified by the mention of the loss of the alabaster heart
- There is another realm that is the opposite of where the Apageans are from
- Apageans are timeless, the Sallowlands are eternal - everything is dead, not decaying. Just dead.
- The Encara Core is the alabaster heart. It's a perfect vessel. To live one's dreams or live forever. 
- If a lich puts itself in the Encara Core, it will live forever
- Options: potion healing, climbing, firebreath, resistance, hill giant strength, water breathing, oil of slipperiness, dimunition, gaseous form, 
- 28 total. 
- 4 potions of water breathing
- healing, 3 resistance, gaseous form, 2 hill giant strength
- 3 healing, climbing, gaseous form, fire breath, one hill giant strength

- We're at sea for three days to go to the other side of the island. We're now heading due south
- Korra gives us potions of waterbreathing
- We're to look for a large fissure in which the light does not work correctly around it. 
- Is a safe point of transit from here to there. 
- We enter the fissure and we see rocky outcroppings
- As we enter the fissure, there's a moment of intense buzzing. 
- we are no longer swimming, the ground is dark and cracked. Mountains in the distance. 
- Everything is still and slightly cold.
- Sound of wind, we can hear it, but not feel it.
- On the ground is scrub grass; colors muted.
- Nothing worth noting are the mountains in the distance.
- No stars, no idea if there are clouds. Don't know if the sun is out. (twilight or daybreak - very dim)

- Three batlike creatures appear



# Episode 2
**2/20/2017**
- We awaken the Tengu and interrogate
- Want the shiny thing for various things (enlightenment, rapture)
- Gathering these amulets from other things
- Known by Tengu since he was a hatchling (Karl)
- We exit the side door as we hear keys entering the orchestra hall
- Tengu are part of the Cult of the Shrouded
- Undead, cult (religous), rock is arcana, and Tengu is animal handling (Whistle is asking where they gather)
- Sentient undead - death knight; skeletal mage (probably not a lich)
- Cult of the Shrouded is one of the oldest. Usually not in trouble legally, but accost travelers. They think that if they steal enough of things, they'll achieve sentience. 
- Believe that the people they accost are more than what they appear to be (shapeshifters? something else?) A key, letter opener....random shit. They're hyper competitive. 
- Rock - alabaster color (or a polished granite), kind of looked like a human heart. kinda looks like it had a valve. Could be used for enchancements. Abderation, divination? Enchanted for a purpose, but not sure what? Could be a lich's vessel.
- Tengu - as far as people know, all the birds are in cults. gather in groups
- We are taken to the precinct and speak with Inspector Sulfur
- As we are being interrogated, but we are suddenly moving very slowly 
- There is suddenly another presence (figure: woman in short robe over mythrll armor, blonde hair, half-elf -Sirrus) in the room with us. She is moving at normal speed. 
- Sarah was actually named Alta and was also a half-elf. They had an agreement with the cult, but they had become more aggressive. 
- What is going on?
- What are the three things she's terrified of?
- Pushing us towards Korra (Southwest coast (just off the coast) we'll know how to find her)
- We reverse-dream-remember country witch in Briar Hurst where Korra lives
- Sun is setting. We remember a horse farm where we can get mounts
- Two small creatures on the left. Small and slightly larger (medium, dwarf like) on the right (non humanoid)
- Sounds like someone is mixing leaves together. Leaves dont match movements
- Small ones try to start flanking us. 
- Small creature is down and not moving
- Creature looks like a large tree stump (medium) with mouth that extends 5 feet
- Sappling has a viney slingshot (small creature)
- Small creature on right is downed by Chuko
- Small on the left is downed by Alphabet
- We make it to Korra's at daybreak. Her hovel is a thatched hut. As we ride up, there's an older halfling woman. She does not seem impressed but she lets us in
- We're half way to third. Make note of what you want to do at 3rd level.
