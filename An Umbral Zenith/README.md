# Episode 2
**2/20/2017**
- We awaken the Tengu and interrogate
- Want the shiny thing for various things (enlightenment, rapture)
- Gathering these amulets from other things
- Known by Tengu since he was a hatchling (Karl)
- We exit the side door as we hear keys entering the orchestra hall
- Tengu are part of the Cult of the Shrouded
- Undead, cult (religous), rock is arcana, and Tengu is animal handling (Whistle is asking where they gather)
- Sentient undead - death knight; skeletal mage (probably not a lich)
- Cult of the Shrouded is one of the oldest. Usually not in trouble legally, but accost travelers. They think that if they steal enough of things, they'll achieve sentience. 
- Believe that the people they accost are more than what they appear to be (shapeshifters? something else?) A key, letter opener....random shit. They're hyper competitive. 
- Rock - alabaster color (or a polished granite), kind of looked like a human heart. kinda looks like it had a valve. Could be used for enchancements. Abderation, divination? Enchanted for a purpose, but not sure what?
