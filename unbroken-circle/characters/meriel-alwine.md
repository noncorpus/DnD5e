### Personality Traits
The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable - or where such things could be hidden.

### Ideals
I don't steal, I trade. I will not take something without leaving something else in it's place.

### Bond
I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.

### Flaw
When I see something I want, I take it.


### Background
1. Found abandoned on the road, adopted by a farmer.
2. Been living easy life on the farm, alleviating boredom with petty theft.
3. I had a role model who was a trained assassin (retired). He gave me a set of thieves tools.
