# The Unbroken Circle

**12/7/2015** - “The Circle is Forged” - Our heroes find themselves facing a host both alien and horrifying despite the delightful music their incursion includes. This lurid dance leads to a final stand and final moments marked by a drop of eerie azure liquid. Only in a sudden awakening do the adventurers find new strengths and the opportunity to ask more questions. These questions lead to a shrine of the spring and the gates of the guards fated to fall.

**11/30/2015** - “The Spring of the Stranger” - We meet our heroes as they greet Seso-Kol 1, the first day of Spring Birth. Each awakens to find a gray stranger gazing to the North, a stranger that no others can see. Their shared awareness unites them and gives them cause to ask questions of a doubting god. In the end, the adventurers resolve to search for the secrets of the stranger, an aspiration stopped only by the approach of a Fated event.
