**3/7/2016** - “The Fate of Those Who Fight” - The sounds of battle ring out in the Wisterwood, pitting a vicious beast of a far-distant land against the hunter of the elf the beast once was. Caught in the fight, witnesses to Reth’s violence, the party struggles to survive, but are dragged to the beginning of the cycle once more as their blood-drenched eyes see another Expectant arrive. When the first dawn comes again, they head back to the forest, seeking to stop the deadly conflict before it begins. With their knowledge of what is to come, they contact Ehadra, the hunter, and convince her to hear them. Her death delayed, Ehadra tells some of her own story, revealing more of the past that led to the ever-encroaching future.

**3/7/2016** - “The Awaited Event” - Our heroes awaken to find their timelines merging; sets of memories intertwine to form a single thread through which the Second Cycle spins. With their knowledge of the events of the days to come and their visions of the lives that fate forged for them, they head into the forest once more, armed with the favors of Captain Temerous. While Chronicler has vanished, Harbinger awaits them in the forest, still seeking that coming “event.” With the Expectant’s blood upon their lips, the party waits until two elves converge on the fated ground. Soon they discover that this ground shall be an arena where Ehadra of the Hapati challenges Reth-Who-Was-Ipthar while the adventurers stand in the crossfire.

**2/29/2016** - “Dance of the Damned” - The party follows the mysterious pulse of light as its echo ripples through them. Skin quaking, they enter a crystalline forest with skewed stars and a strangely familiar satellite in the heavens. In the shining, phosphorescent woods, the dancing shadows of their enemies are easy to see, and they find that the monsters that once killed them now fall beneath their blades. Yet it is the dark sapling at the heart of the forest that vexes them as it pulls fell beasts out of the rift from which it grows. Despite a valiant battle, the heroes fall and rise anew at the start of the cycle. But is it truly the same dawn that they’ve seen before?

**2/22/2016** - "Operation: Molotov" - A massive treant corners the party, warning them of the dangers of entering the forest. They enter the forest. The party witnesses a strange clump of threatening plants. They throw a molotov at it. The adventurers encounter a village of beautiful aberrations with ridiculous names. They make the village leader, an Oracle, scream in terror, then throw a molotov at them as well. Each and every day the forest's heart grows closer, but our heroes can already feel the clarion call to dance echoing from within.

**2/8/2016** -“BRUDKIN!” - Faced with the ballgown-bedecked Harbinger, the adventurers learn more about the Expectant and their knowledge of what is fated (while frightening one of their companions in the process). Yet little is more frightening than a deadly battle with a Gnoll hunting party, which requires all the party’s martial might to survive. The rewards, however, are surprising, if one can call raw Gnoll flesh and blood ale a reward. Further into the forest, the mysteries deepen. Who is the deadly hunter hiding in the woods? What became of the party’s rescued Druid? And why do treants patrol the woods, searching for trespassers like our heroes?

The adventurers give their opinions on sacrifice and decide on the actions to take when innocent blood is threatened.
