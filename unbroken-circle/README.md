# The Unbroken Circle

**11/30/2015** - “The Spring of the Stranger” - We meet our heroes as they greet Seso-Kol 1, the first day of Spring Birth. Each awakens to find a gray stranger gazing to the North, a stranger that no others can see. Their shared awareness unites them and gives them cause to ask questions of a doubting god. In the end, the adventurers resolve to search for the secrets of the stranger, an aspiration stopped only by the approach of a Fated event.
