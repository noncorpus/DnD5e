**2/22/2016** - "Operation: Molotov" - A massive treant corners the party, warning them of the dangers of entering the forest. They enter the forest. The party witnesses a strange clump of threatening plants. They throw a molotov at it. The adventurers encounter a village of beautiful aberrations with ridiculous names. They make the village leader, an Oracle, scream in terror, then throw a molotov at them as well. Each and every day the forest's heart grows closer, but our heroes can already feel the clarion call to dance echoing from within.

**2/8/2016** -“BRUDKIN!” - Faced with the ballgown-bedecked Harbinger, the adventurers learn more about the Expectant and their knowledge of what is fated (while frightening one of their companions in the process). Yet little is more frightening than a deadly battle with a Gnoll hunting party, which requires all the party’s martial might to survive. The rewards, however, are surprising, if one can call raw Gnoll flesh and blood ale a reward. Further into the forest, the mysteries deepen. Who is the deadly hunter hiding in the woods? What became of the party’s rescued Druid? And why do treants patrol the woods, searching for trespassers like our heroes?

The adventurers give their opinions on sacrifice and decide on the actions to take when innocent blood is threatened.

Upon witnessing another bear witness to the Chronicler, the Fated Three seek to induct the smuggler, and so become the Fated Four.
