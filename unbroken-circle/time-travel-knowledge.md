# Time Travel Knowledge

Stuff we learned that might help us persuade people that we really are stuck in a time loop.

**Norden, Temple of Kol**. Had breakfast of spring greens, woke just before dawn, dreamt of cake and wine, which he longs for and has not had in so very long. Does not think very much of his blessings.

**Gate Guards, Baron's Place**. Garett and Falstaff. Falstaff is the eldest of seven, all named after lucky charms. He took care of them growing up. Sent us to Captain Teraris at the northern bulwarks.
