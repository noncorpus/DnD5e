## Adventure Log

### Arrival at Greenest

Making their way towards the the city of Greenest as caravan guards, Sparks, Kurt, and Rinn found the city in flames and under attack by a blue dragon.

The big blue beast kept strafing the center of town, and as the three adventurers came closer to investigate, the party discovered roving bands of hooded figures and kobolds setting fire to buildings and apparently searching for something.

Their first attempt at engaging the cultists met with a near disastrous end.  Rinn and Sparks nearly bled out at the end of the encounter, and only the unfailing harassment of Kurt's arrows bought the group enough time to recover.

After a brief rest (and several bandages), the group proceeded more cautiously into town.  Further encounters with the hooded figures (who bore tattoos of the evil dragon god, Tiamat) and their kobold cohorts were successful in confrontation or evasion.

Having rescued Linan Swift, as well as her mortally wounded husband and a handful of children - the group picked up _[another group of citizens](rinn001)_ and managed to barely gain entrance to the city's keep.

### A Desperate Rescue

January 26:  After having saved a number of townsfolk from the assault by the Cultists of Tiamat, the party was escorted by the Castellan Escobert to meet with Governor Nighthill, the leader of Greenest.  Nighthill requested the assistance of the party in rescuing additional townsfolk who may still be besieged by the Cultists, and if possible to secure a prisoner for interrogation (specifically any Cultist wearing purple robes).  The group was shown to a secret egress from the keep that was disguised as a sewer outlet.  The keep-side entrance was secured from inside and required a specific pattern of knocks to alert the guards within to open the door.  The other end of the tunnel was secured with a lock whose key was given to the party by Escobert.

After dealing with a minor infestation of rats in the tunnel, the party ambushed and dispatched with a group of cultists and kobolds.  Continuing to the east along the stream, the party came across a group of cultists who were attempting obtain entry to a temple.  A figure wearing leather armor (rather than the standard black robes that the other cultists had worn), and a five pointed black mask was directing the assault.  The perimeter of the building was also being patrolled by cultists, kobolds, and a pair of ambush drakes.

Using his divine ability, Rinn attempted to charm the figure (who the party learned was named Claw Raather) using a illusory double of himself.  The deception was unsuccessful, and having been alerted to the presence of the party, Raather sent out the patrol to locate those responsible.

### Rescue Success, and a New Mission

The party waited for the patrol to split into two smaller groups before sneaking out of a window.  Upon exiting the building, they came face to face with the first smaller group.  Fortunately, they were able to dispatch of the cultists and their kobold and drake cohorts before they could alert the second patrol.

Meanwhile, Raather had been directing a group of three cultists using a battering ram against the front doors of the temple.  They had nearly completed breaking down the entrance when the party opened fire on Raather with crossbow, spell, and bow.  Rinn's crossbow bolt, and Sparks' fire bolt found their mark, and Raather was brought down.  The three Cultists at the temple dropped the ram and charged the party.  Meanwhile, having been alerted to the attack on Raather, the second patrol raced back to also engage the party.

Despite a bloody and fiery battle, the party emerged victorious.  After some coaxing, Rinn convinced the townsfolk within to come out and leave with them.  Upon returning to the keep with 40 townsfolk, and a priest of Chauntea, the party was given a new task.  on the southwestern end of town, Governor Nighthill pointed out the location of Greenest's sole mill.  Fearing its destruction, Nighthill requested the party make haste to prevent the structure from being destroyed.

Once again, the party made use of the secret exit, and followed the stream to the west.  In the distance, they could make out four humanoid shapes.  Unsure of whether the group was friend or foe, Rinn called to the group while everyone prepared to fire if the group proved hostile.  When the four individuals were within crossbow range, their hostile intent was made clear and the party opened fire.  Immediately, one of the four was felled.  In an even match against the remaining three, the party was victorious, and managed to subdue of the apparent mercenaries.

Approaching the mill, the party noticed that the structure was unharmed, while the buildings that surrounded it were on fire.  Checking the perimeter, Rinn opened the door and called inside.  Having heard movement from inside that likely signaled additional potential enemies, Rinn used the unconscious mercenary as a decoy to ascertain the nature of the hiding occupants.  Upon exposing the mercenary's body, three spears immediately lanced and killed the comatose soldier.  The party could hear the unmistakable curse from the mercenaries three friends within as they jumped down and prepared to engage the party...
