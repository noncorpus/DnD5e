## Adventure Log

### Arrival at Greenest

Making their way towards the the city of Greenest as caravan guards, Sparks, Kurt, and Rinn found the city in flames and under attack by a blue dragon.

The big blue beast kept strafing the center of town, and as the three adventurers came closer to investigate, the party discovered roving bands of hooded figures and kobolds setting fire to buildings and apparently searching for something.

Their first attempt at engaging the cultists met with a near disastrous end.  Rinn and Sparks nearly bled out at the end of the encounter, and only the unfailing harassment of Kurt's arrows bought the group enough time to recover.

After a brief rest (and several bandages), the group proceeded more cautiously into town.  Further encounters with the hooded figures (who bore tattoos of the evil dragon god, Tiamat) and their kobold cohorts were successful in confrontation or evasion.

Having rescued Linan Swift, as well as her mortally wounded husband and a handful of children - the group picked up _[another group of citizens](rinn001)_ and managed to barely gain entrance to the city's keep.
