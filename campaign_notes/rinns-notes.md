# Rinn's Campaign Notes

## Greenest

### <a name="arrival-at-greenest"></a>Welcome to Greenest!

That's a big dragon.  I have to admit that when I first caught a whiff of the smoke coming from the fires in Greenest, my first inclination was to loot.  Then I saw the dragon, and I thought to myself, "Who could loot at a time like this?  We should probably thank The Lord of Necessary Pretexts that we didn't get here early, and go back the way we came."  Well as it so happens, my curiosity got the better of me, and we skulked down to take a closer look.

~~Snakes~~ Cultists.  Why did it have to be ~~snakes~~ Cultists?  Roving bands of the hooded bastards were roaming the town.  The first group we encountered nearly killed Sparks and me.  Thank our Lord and Thief that they didn't have bows, and thank that Thief again that Kurt had his.

We checked one of the bodies of one of the ones that Sparks lit up and found a tattoo that looked unsettlingly too much like one you'd find on a worshiper of Tiamat.  Yeah, that Tiamat.  Now, I know what you're thinking...  You're saying, "But Uncle Rinn, what if Charcoal Chuckles here just lost a bet in a bar, and this hideously reasonable facsimile of a Tiamat tat was the stake."  And you know, I'd probably agree with you, but that Big Blue Thunderfuck overhead, blasting the hell out of Greenest with lightning was one solid coin-ki-dink too many to seriously consider otherwise.

The rest of our encounters with those hooded asshats were also one-sided, although it was the three of us who were calling the shots.  Oh, and before I forget - they had friends with them.  Several groups we attacked or evaded had kobolds.  I think the best part of the day was watching Kurt pin one to a wall with an arrow.

We also picked up some peasant stragglers.  Linan Swift was almost competent enough with that spear of hers to keep a band of those overgrown geckos from killing her family.  Fortunately for all of them, we came along and finished the job.  At Linan's suggestion, we made our way towards the city's keep, and picked up some more ~~sandbagged weight~~ helpless bystanders along the way.

<a name="rinn001"></a> I'm really glad that I didn't try to use that second group of peasants or their children as cultist bait.  I'd be lying if the phrase "We don't have to outrun the cultists.  We just have to outrun these serfs..." wasn't uttered more than once.

Still, "All's well that ends in boon for Rinn".  Yeah, you can totally quote me on that.

Now, time to find out what in the Nine Hells is going on here...
