## The Story So Far

**A Glimpse of Moonlight in a Summer Storm**

"You know my condition."

The man turned towards the office door but stood still, waiting for an answer. Even though he was shorter than almost everyone he met, he knew that at this moment, he had all the power in the room. His long years at this job had given him that much, along with a dullness to his once-shining plumage and an exhausted weight in his light, avian frame.

"Fine," the woman said after a quiet pause. "But...you're sure you can do it?"

Ashi made a small, tired sound, half cough, half chuckle, that was almost drowned in the patter of rain. "Carry this little stick down half the Sword Coast in the worst summer storm in a decade, in under five days? Sure. If not five days, I'll get it there early on the sixth. I'll give you half price if it's any more." He tucked the small wooden cylindar in a chest pocket, patting it with practiced confidence.

"Six days will be too late," she said to the floor in a voice of somber anger, leaning forward with her arms against the desk. It sounded wrong to him. When people hired his services, they tended to sound excited, hopeful or sly. You hire a smuggler to make an illicit fortune or carry out a cunning, less-than-legal plan. This woman was afraid, maybe more. "It's got to be five days," she said.

Ashi took a step toward the open window and the raging storm. The sun had set hours ago. Even his sharp eyes could see little more than the dark disarray of clouds and rain. "A decade ago, I could spend five days aloft and grin the whole time, but even then, winds like these would give me trouble. It's exhausting. You're constantly fighting them, and you've got to stay focused the whole time." He let his words hang in the air as warm, lamplit currents stirred with chill storm winds darting through the open window in front of him.

"Why do you care?" the woman finally asked. "Why do you always insist that your clients explain why they want you to make a delivery? Why have _that_ as your one condition?" 

Plenty of clients had asked that over the years, but some indefinable undercurrent in her tone threw him off balance. He was prepared to judge her, not the other way around. "I don't ever remember living with my people," he began. "My first memories were of the monks who took me in. They always said I just fell from the sky."

"They took me in," he went on, gathering speed. "They raised me, they taught me. Reading, writing, sneaking, fighting, philosphy, music -- though I was crap with anything but the panpipes," he said with a chuckle that almost felt genuine. "But I never quite got it. It's not that I didn't agree with their ideas, I simply couldn't see how it all fit together. So one day, I just...flew away."

"I found cities and towns and castles and seas and all sorts of amazing things. I met people and made friends. I was naive, though. Some of those friends were the wrong sort of people. I didn't ask any questions when they asked me for favors and...people got hurt."

It was Ashi's turn to pause. Decades later and those memories still stung. "I learn from my mistakes," he added eventually. Their eyes met, and they both knew he was done with his story.

The woman turned to the shelves behind her. She pulled down a heavy box, opening it and reaching inside. Holding a silk-wrapped bundle in two hands, she crossed the room with a speed and urgency that Ashi wouldn't have expected of her. She set the flat, fist-sized package in his hands, saying, "Give it everything you've got, and this will keep you going." With a wry grin, she added, "I always like the refrain from Elminster's Charge."

She stepped back. "That 'little stick' you're delivering is a message carrier warded against opening by the wrong person. The letter inside it holds our latest intelligence on the Dragon Cult's army. We think we know their next move."

"Get it to the monk I told you about," she finished. "Get it there in five days."

"You're not really from the local Thieves' Guild, are you?" he asked, knowing that silence was the only answer he'd get. He turned back to the window.

A gust of rain-soaked wind blew against him, bringing with it the familiar feeling of air grabbing at his wings. He set his hands on the sill and leaned into the next gust. The storm was as intense as ever, but for a moment, the clouds crept apart to reveal a crescent of white moonlight.

He jumped.

## Sir Baldric of Daggerford ##

Baldric was an orphan who was taken in by the kind clergymen and woman of the Sanctuary Chapel devoted to Helm in Daggerford. He was sheltered and raised as an acolyte, and the promises of Helm's protection were always professed.  Having otherwise only known the cruelty of the life of a homeless orphan, Baldric accepted these teachings at face value and became an ardent believer - possibly destined to take the cloth of Helm himself upon reaching the appropriate age.

When a band of thugs broke into the Chapel while evading the town guard, Baldric witnessed his friends, mentors, and guardians butchered at the hands of the wicked.  When the perpetrators had dispersed, Baldric ran to the guards station.  It was before the bribed indifference of the watch captain that Baldric learned that the supposed protection and justice of Helm was more abstract than he otherwise supposed.  The thugs had been part of a larger syndicate of crime, and their leader had placed coin into the pockets of specific officials of the guard to prevent the expected pursuits of justice.

Baldric fell to a melancholy, with the failed promises of a god floating atop a pool of its worshipers blood. While not so foolish as to deny the power of Helm or any other so-called diety, Baldric now understood that the truest and surest justice for the victims of evil was to be had at the sword of the good.  Since Helm couldn't seem to be bothered to raise that blade, Baldric did.

With a new purpose and vision, Baldric began to travel along the Sword Coast.  It wasn't long before he began to hear the rumors of the deeds of the Dragon Cult south of Baldur's Gate...

## Pearl Bkaw ##

When she was almost three, nearing the ago of maturity amongst the Aarokocra, a gust of elemental wind knocked her from the skies and through an astral gateway from her home in the Plane of Air to Faerun.

It sucked.

Since then, she has led a wandering lifestyle, living in the forest and mountains near the sword coast, rarely encountering her own kind. It's given her a sense of independence and strong confidence in her own abilities, but also a sense of loneliness that, in time, grew into a wariness of others.

One of her fondest memories of home is the campfire stories of battles against the green dragon who ravaged their settlements. When she heard tales of a dragon cult, Juilin decided to take wing and see if she could learn more. After over a decade alone, this could be a chance to finally meet people and find a place where she belonged.

Besides, there wasn't anything better to do.
