## Sparks ##

Sparks was a troublesome child, manifesting sorcerous powers at an early age. He would frequently manifest fire magiks when his mother held him, leading to more than his share of dropping incidents.

He still didn't understand his abilities when, at the age of three, he started a wildfire that spread to the Eldrin Dam, the collapse of which caused major flooding through his clan's holdings. The event is still considered the worst disaster in clan Kureldar's history, and Sparks still doesn't trust water.

After the Great Flood, Sparks was a shame to his clan. He was sent away to the clan's remote Quinin Archival Library, where the clan stores unwanted and forbidden books. He's grown up alone, reading and experimenting with his own powers. He loves books, which combine his two favorite things: knowledge and kindling.

Growing up alone, Sparks never learned how to be around people. Together, his isolation and sorcerous powers have left him socially awkward and just the teeniest, tinest bit insane.

After years alone -- and in a library, no less -- he's made extensive study of social interaction, memorizing long books about party tricks, trivia, pickup lines, flirting, persuasion and other social skills. He's never had any real practice, but he's totally looking forward to trying it out.

Sparks has brass scales rimmed in shades of fiery metallic red. He likes to think that all the dragonborn ladies find him quite a looker, but since he's never actually met any, he's really just covering for his own insecurities.

Stretching for a book on the top shelp on his twentieth birthday, Sparks realized that an adult Dragonborn would have earned an adult name by his age -- but no one ever came back for him. Abandoned by family and clan, Sparks decided to leave his exile and find a name on his own. He's ready to travel the world, see exotic places and discover ancient wonders. Along the way, he hopes to find himself.

P.S. what do ancient wonders look like in flames?

## Riardon "Rinn" Am-Tyro ##

Riardon Am-Tyro barely escaped the first time the constables tried to execute him.  Well, _technically_, the constabulary wasn't going to kill him - Sir Fancy Pants the Noble of Stick-in-Arse was going to do it.  The enforcers of law were just looking the other way.

Fortunately, a high priestess of...  Azuth?  Or was it Deneir?  Doesn't matter, because the lady was full of cockatrice droppings either way.  Jana was a priestess, but not of any god or goddess that Sir Pants would show deference to.  In fact, if he (or the folks of the town guard) knew that Jana was a (proverbial) card carrying member of Mask's clergy, there might have been a fine further disagreement that day.

Such as it was (and as Riardon would come to find out), the only reason that Sir Pants noticed the subtle cut of his coin bag was that Jana had set Riardon up.  She intervened, playing the stern priestess of a high power who would instruct the young urchin in civility and manners (and such law-abiding what-not).  Rinn is pretty certain that she used some divine favor to extricate him from the wrath of Pants - but the constables allowed Jana custody (probably happy to avoid the paperwork of a strangled body on the street).

Jana did in fact instruct the young boy.  The true lessons of civility and manners were indeed imparted, in that they serve only to provide social mobility, and grant access to places and people to whom the standard cutpurse would never see.

Rinn became a devotee and initiate of Mask, the Father of Necessary Pretexts.  But theft in a smaller city can only reap from so many souls.  Rinn seeks bigger and better adventures, and opportunities to spread the mischief mission of his god.
