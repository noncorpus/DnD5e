* **Personality Traits**. Subtle sarcasm, mixed with (mostly) good intentions. The lesson of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" isn't not to lie, but never to tell the same lie twice.
* **Ideals**. Lay low the hubris of the proud with divine works of mischief.
* **Bonds**. Daily ritual requiring simple sleight of hand (card trick, coin-behind-the-ear trick, etc.)
* **Flaws**. Suffers the foolish pride of others poorly. An unduly arrogant individual will require Rinn to administer humility (see ideal).

### The Story So Far*

Riardon Am-Tyro barely escaped the first time the constables tried to execute him. Well, technically, the constabulary wasn't going to kill him - Sir Fancy Pants the Noble of Stick-in-Arse was going to do it. The enforcers of law were just looking the other way.

Fortunately, a high priestess of... Azuth? Or was it Deneir? Doesn't matter, because the lady was full of cockatrice droppings either way. Jana was a priestess, but not of any god or goddess that Sir Pants would show deference to. In fact, if he (or the folks of the town guard) knew that Jana was a (proverbial) card carrying member of Mask's clergy, there might have been a fine further disagreement that day.

Such as it was (and as Riardon would come to find out), the only reason that Sir Pants noticed the subtle cut of his coin bag was that Jana had set Riardon up. She intervened, playing the stern priestess of a high power who would instruct the young urchin in civility and manners (and such law-abiding what-not). Rinn is pretty certain that she used some divine favor to extricate him from the wrath of Pants - but the constables allowed Jana custody (probably happy to avoid the paperwork of a strangled body on the street).

Jana did in fact instruct the young boy. The true lessons of civility and manners were indeed imparted, in that they serve only to provide social mobility, and grant access to places and people to whom the standard cutpurse would never see.

Rinn became a devotee and initiate of Mask, the Father of Necessary Pretexts. But theft in a smaller city can only reap from so many souls. Rinn seeks bigger and better adventures, and opportunities to spread the mischief mission of his god.

### * - Disclaimer

Yes, Matt knows that in many ways Rinn is a clear clone/rip-off of [Scott Lynch's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Lynch) Locke Lamora character ([Gentleman Bastard series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Lynch#The_Gentleman_Bastard_Sequence)).  Matt doesn't care because Matt knows that the party needs a cleric, but he still clings to rogue-archetypes.
