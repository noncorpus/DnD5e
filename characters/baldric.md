* **Personality Traits**. Severe, determined, takes-no-shit
* **Ideals**. A thief with no hands is a thief no more; a murderer put to the sword will put no other to the same.
* **Bonds**. The former site of the Sanctuary Chapel to Helm in Daggerford.  While Sir Baldric holds this site in grave reverence, he will not visit unless duty were to demand it.
* **Flaws**. If Sir Baldric's ability or resolve to punish the wicked is called into question, he will react...  badly.

## Never Look Back

Baldric was an orphan who was taken in by the kind clergymen and woman of the Sanctuary Chapel devoted to Helm in Daggerford. He was sheltered and raised as an acolyte, and the promises of Helm's protection were always professed.  Having otherwise only known the cruelty of the life of a homeless orphan, Baldric accepted these teachings at face value and became an ardent believer - possibly destined to take the cloth of Helm himself upon reaching the appropriate age.

When a band of thugs broke into the Chapel while evading the town guard, Baldric witnessed his friends, mentors, and guardians butchered at the hands of the wicked.  When the perpetrators had dispersed, Baldric ran to the guards station.  It was before the bribed indifference of the watch captain that Baldric learned that the supposed protection and justice of Helm was more abstract than he otherwise supposed.  The thugs had been part of a larger syndicate of crime, and their leader had placed coin into the pockets of specific officials of the guard to prevent the expected pursuits of justice.

Baldric fell to a melancholy, with the failed promises of a god floating atop a pool of its worshipers blood. While not so foolish as to deny the power of Helm or any other so-called diety, Baldric now understood that the truest and surest justice for the victims of evil was to be had at the sword of the good.  Since Helm couldn't seem to be bothered to raise that blade, Baldric did.

With a new purpose and vision, Baldric began to travel along the Sword Coast.  It wasn't long before he began to hear the rumors of the deeds of the Dragon Cult south of Baldur's Gate...
