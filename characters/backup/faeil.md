### The Story So Far

Faeil's first meaningful memory is of playing cards with his mother. No matter how much they played, it seemed that his mother always found a way to win. To a little boy, it was just his mother being the god that is a mother, but as he grew older, he realized that it wasn't just her experience: she was cheating. 

That's the first and last life lesson he got before she died: don't play the game, play the person. The rules give everyone even odds, so if you want to win, you'd better find another way. Besides, rules only matter as far as they're enforced.

As he was wandering the streets, he was taken in by a kooky old priest of Mask and her star pupil, Riardon, who were attracted to Faeil's creative approach to the rules. He never took to the gods, though, not even the more amusing ones. Faeil saw Rinn as the brother he never had. When Rinn left the temple to make his way in the world, the thing called home felt suddenly hollow and foreign. As the sun set over the town square, Faeil found his feet taking him away from hearth and bed. Before he knew it, Faeil was outside the city gates in the light of a rising moon.

He never looked back.
