* **Personality Traits**. Full of witty aphorisms and has a proverb for every occassion. Most don't make sense.
* **Ideals**. Community and civilization (were built by beer).
* **Bonds**. My name is Dellaryn Dureldar. You burned down my brewery. Prepare to die.
* **Flaws**. Revenge is a dish best served in a 64oz MegaGiantSooperCup, and while the guy behind the counter is giving away extras because he's trying to get rid of exccess stock before he closes for the night.

### The Story So Far

Raised in the Monastery of the Whispering Winds, Dellaryn spent his first hundred years before ever speaking a word. The monks take a strict vow of silence that pervades everything they do, endeavering not just to avoid speech, but to avoid making sound of any sort.

In his formative years, Del received a thorough monastery education in brewing and alchemy. The monastery's brewery was its lifeblood, supplying both plentiful nutrition to its inhabitants and its sole source of income. Brews of the Whispering Winds, shipped down from the mountains and across Faerun, are considered a prize by those fortunate enough to obtain them.

As is the custom in the Elvish mountain monastery, Dellaryn left the Whispering Winds after his first century. While most monks, unable to speak and untrained in worldly skills, make their homes in the wilderness, Del wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs in taverns and inns. He'd lend his hand to brewers and barkeeps alike, picking up language from the tavern throng. It left an...interesting...mark upon his speech that persists to this day.

In his second century, Del had a run in with a particularly friendly brass dragon in a small village near the Eldrin Dam. While the details of that fateful night are a bit fuzzy, he's fairly sure that it's no coincidence that the Dragonborn clan of Kureldar was formed nearby and shortly thereafter. 

By his fourth century, Dellaryn took over a brewery and tavern of his own, joining the brewer's guild and making a name for himself. He's as well known for his skill as he is for his willingness to help new members join his craft. Unless those students go on to make overly bitter beers with no cause to exist. Then those breweries seem to have hilarious accidents, and no one dares think about the Brewing Monk who spent his first century learning to move silently through the mountains.

Dellaryn joins the party after in the [village/town/cave] of [wherever the party is] after the [bad guys] the burn down his brewery. That's a mistake they're going to regret very, very soon...
