# Campaign Notes

## Adventure Log

### October 19
- Rolling up characters
- We were all recent arrivals to Bessell and were all summarily tossed in the clink for crimes various and sundry
- Jails full, apparently this is a city of criminals
- Met Assillus in a nearby cell. He lead a failed rebellion against the Archon. He looks like a regal dude (think Thor)
- No one knows much abput the Archon; he is a figure veiled in shadow and mystery.
- Akai originally built the city, but it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. Sounds like undercity exploring time!
- Found a puzzle in each cell, struggled to solve them, but ultimately prevailed.
- Magical edible gems revealed! Giving us +1 bump to attributes. Halfling ate two. Fat little bastard.
- Bars are slowly creaking apart...
- Guards and some other guy showed up and said something vaguely ominous and threatening.
- Everyone knocked asleep by an irresistible plot pause.

### October 26
