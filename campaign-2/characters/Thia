### The Story So Far

When she was almost three, nearing the ago of maturity amongst the Aarokocra, a gust of elemental wind knocked her from the skies and through an astral gateway from her home in the Plane of Air to Faerun.

It sucked.

Since then, she has led a wandering lifestyle, living in the forest and mountains near the sword coast, rarely encountering her own kind. It's given her a sense of independence and strong confidence in her own abilities, but also a sense of loneliness that, in time, grew into a wariness of others.

One of her fondest memories of home is the campfire stories of battles against the green dragon who ravaged their settlements. When she heard tales of a dragon cult, Juilin decided to take wing and see if she could learn more. After over a decade alone, this could be a chance to finally meet people and find a place where she belonged.

Besides, there wasn't anything better to do.
