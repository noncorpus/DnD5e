Tezcatlipoca appeared to Nezahualcoyotl one night at a crossroads in the form of an old man with a missing foot and bestowed the Codex of Chalchiuhtotolin upon his protege. The codez can manifest itself as a smoking mirror of obsidian or as a deer skin or paper book. In all its forms, the glyhs and logograms radiate an eerie light and an energy that has been described as intense, uncomfortable or simply evil.

### The Story So Far



# Tezcatlipoca
Tezcatlipoca is the one supreme omnipotent god and all other gods are simply manifestations of this one great being. He is sometimes known as Black Tezcatlipoca or the ‘Smoking Mirror’, god of the day ruler over all of the earth, sometimes referred to as the smoking mirror. He is also known as Blue Tezcatlipoca, the ‘Hummingbird Sorcerer’, god of Tenochtitlán, where he is associated with the sun and the war god Huitzilopochtli. He can manifest as Red Tezcatlipoca, the ‘Flayed One’ and associated with the gods Camaxtli and Xipe Totec (god of the Tlaxcaltecans) or as White Tezcatlipoca, the ‘Plumed Serpent’ or Quetzalcóatl, god of the Cholula. Yet another manifestation of the god is as Tepeyolohtli, the jaguar god that lived in the center of the mountain of the earth.

Ever-present, Tezcatlipoca can intervene directly in human affairs to bring both happiness and sorrow. Tezcatlipoca takes on more sinister connotations when he is known as lord of the shadows or night, a sorcerer of black magic and the bringer of evil, death and destruction. This face of the god is known as Chalchiuhtecólotl, ‘Precious Owl’ or Chalchiuhtotolin, ‘Precious Turkey’. Also associated with conflict he is known as Yaotl or ‘Enemy’ and is a patron of warriors and their training camps (telpochcalli). His nature is capricious, though, for sometimes he can be found at crossroads at the dead of night, ready to challenge the unsuspecting.
