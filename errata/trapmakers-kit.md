_Trapmaker’s Kit_
* DEX-based Tool (can gain proficiency)
* Cost: 40 GP
    * Must be “restocked” for 10 GP every 15 uses.
* Allows creations of traps using the following base:
    * __Create DC:__ 10
    * __Trap HP:__ 5
    * __Trap AC:__ 10
    * __Damage Type:__ Slashing / Piercing / Bludgeoning (your choice)
    * __Damage (Immediate):__ 1d4
    * __Damage (Per Round):__ 0
    * __Condition:__ None
    * __Effect Duration:__ 1 mi.
    * __Area:__ 5 x 5 ft.
    * __Stealth:__ 12
    * __Reusable:__ No
    * __Save DC:__ 8 + Trapmaker’s Kit Skill DEX Save
* To create sophisticated traps, choose the traits you wish for the trap to have on the Trap Traits table. For each trait, increase the Create DC by the listed amount.
* Once all the traits are selected, the trapmaker may then reduce the DC with any of the following materials:
    * Money (pays for finer materials, smaller parts, more consistent mechanisms, etc.): __Create DC -1/5 GP Spent__
    * Ingredients (better ingredients allow traps to be made more easily)
        * Some ingredients may only reduce DC for certain kinds of traps (example: Create DC -5 for a Bludgeoning trap that affects a 10 x 10 area).
        * In some games, some Trap Traits may require certain ingredients (example: your DM explains that a Radiant damage trap cannot be made without shards of a shattered angelic weapon, which also give Create DC -15).
        * Ingredients should be able to be purchased (blacksmith, locksmith, trapper, etc.) or found (Investigation / Survival in locations where ingredients might be found)
        * Ingredients will be added at the DM's discretion and will provide bonuses as determined by the DM.
    * Additional Circumstances (as ruled by your GM)
        * Trapmaker’s Workshop: __Create DC -10__ (Basically a MEGA Trapmaker's Kit - Costs 1200 GP to build; 30 GP to restock after 15 uses)
        * Trapmaker's Expertise: If your character is able to gain additional proficiency in a certain format of trap, your DM may allow a Create DC reduction to that type.
* When you are ready to create the trap, roll a Trapmaker's Kit check. On a success, the trap was completed. On a failure, the trap breaks and you roll 1d6. On a 1, the trap springs as it is breaking, and you are subjected to the trap’s effect.
    * Time to Complete (8 hr. or under can be done during a Long Rest, 1 hr. or under can be done during a Short Rest)
        * Create DC 0-5: 5 mi.
        * Create DC 6-10: 1 hr.
        * Create DC 11-15: 2 hr.
        * Create DC 15-20: 4 hr.
        * Create DC 20-25: 8 hr.
        * Create DC 25+: DM Discretion
* Trap Rules: 
    * _Setting a Trap_ — An experienced trap maker can set any trap within 5 minutes. However, to do so in less time makes the trap easier to notice. If setting a trap is rushed, anyone who attempts to find it has ADV on Perception or Investigation checks to do so.
    * _Noticing a Trap_ — If someone is actively seeking to find traps, they roll Perception or Investigation (their choice) against the trap’s Stealth score. Otherwise, they use their Passive Perception against the trap’s Stealth score.
    * _Reusing a Trap_ — When a trap is sprung and it was made to be Reusable, roll 1d20 + Trapmaker’s Skill. If the check exceeds 10 and is not a natural 1, the trap can be collected and reused. Otherwise it is broken.
    * _Breaking a Trap_ — Anyone who can see a trap that isn’t broken can make an attack against it. If the attack beats the trap’s AC, resolve attack as normal. If the attack does not beat the trap’s AC, it springs with the attacker as the target.
